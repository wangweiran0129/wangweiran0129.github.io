<h1>About Myself</h1>
I am currently working as a 5G Baseband Software Developer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) in Stockholm, Sweden.

Prior to that, I obtained my MSc from [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/en) in 2023 and my programme was [ICT Innovation](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/ict-innovation) - track Cloud and Network Infrastructure. During my master study, I did an one-year exchange during the 2021-2022 academic year at [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland where I also finished my master thesis. I achieved my BSc majoring in Software Engineering [Dalian University of Technology (DUT)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in Dalian, China in 2020.

For my future plan, I am now seeking for a PhD in the US/Europe in the application period beginning in this September 2023.
The current progress (continuous updating based on the chronological order)

<h1>My Research Interests</h1>
My research interest, in one single sentence, is the design and optimization of networked system (especially for the low-latency network). Specifically, it straddles the complex domain of networked systems and its interdisciplinary interfaces, include but not limited to:
<ul id="research_interest">
 <li> Network resource allocation and deployment </li>
 <li> The research on Network Calculus itself and its application in the design of performance guaranteed networked systems </li>
 <li> The application of machine learning and game theory in the optimization of networked systems </li>
 <li> Telecom areas including 5G RAN and Cloud RAN (Now, I am working on the virtualized digital unit in uplink control plane)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h1>Do I really love my research direction?</h1>
When I was young, I harbored dreams of becoming a pilot or aircraft designer, but my high myopia made this path unattainable. However, this setback led me to find a different kind of ‘cloud’ to contribute to - cloud computing. Emotionally, I see parallels between cloud computing and airplanes: both serve as carriers, transporting passengers or network packets from sources to destinations. My curiosity extends beyond the technicalities of the human element - how these journeys impact people’s lives and emotions. I recall a poignant moment on a flight where a passenger behind me wept over a relative’s health issue. It was then that I wished I could have the ability to build faster networked systems, capable of conveying human sentiments and concerns more swiftly. This experience fueled my aspiration for cloud computing to evolve beyond a mere technological marvel. I envision it as a medium that not only enhances efficiency but also connects and empathizes with human emotions.

<h1>Fun Facts</h1>
<ul id="fun_facts">
  <li> I hold the habit of taking photographs, and I focus more on the landscape where you can find my gallery on the tap above.</li>
  <li> I can't say no to food all over the world, and I try to learn as much as possible where you can also find what I've cooked on the tap above.</li>
  <li> I am willing to do some sports that are usually sponsored by Red Bull. Skiing in the Swiss Alps during the winter ⛷️ (The Swiss black path is still challenging for me, but I can handle the blue and red ones without any difficulties) and diving in the Mediterranean during the summer 🤿 have been my annual sacred cow. Yes, I have an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ch8Ajgckvbv-Z73niMWj1QG_5HpNdOCn/view?usp=sharing">open water diving certificate</a>. I also have a plan to upgrade my diving certificate to an advanced one and perhaps try to do underwater photography.</li>
  <li> I travel quite a lot, and I've been to 🇹🇭 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇳🇱 🇫🇮 🇸🇪 🇦🇹 🇨🇭 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇮🇹 🇳🇴 🇩🇪 🇮🇸 🇲🇨 🇲🇹 🇩🇰 </li>
  <li> I don't drink alcohol. It is not because I don't want or I'm not allowed. It is because I'm allergic to alcohol, which makes me lose lots of fun in Europe.</li>
  <li> I'm a Barcelona loyalist, and I've been watching Barcelona games since 2010.</li>
  <li> I'm learning how to drive and my family has recently changed a new car. Due to these, I'm obsessed with performance cars, especially Audi RS7. However, I may bow to life by choosing a Tesla Model 3 or Audi A3 at last. Oh, I also begin to watch F1 from this year.</li>
  <li> I'm too idealistic sometimes.

      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did!</a></li>
