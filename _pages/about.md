About Myself
======
I am currently working as a 5G Baseband Software Developer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) in Stockholm, Sweden.

Prior to that, I obtained my MSc from [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/en) in 2023 and my programme was [ICT Innovation](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/ict-innovation) - track Cloud and Network Infrastructure at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855). During my master study, I did an one-year exchange during the 2022-2023 academic year at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Lausanne, Switzerland where I also finished my master thesis. During my study at KTH, I was honored the KTH Covid-19 Financial Aid Scholarship based on my academic excellence.

I achieved my BSc from the [School of Software Technology](https://ssdut.dlut.edu.cn/en.htm) of [Dalian University of Technology (DUT)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in Dalian, China in 2020. I was awarded the Outstanding Graduation Thesis of DUT and the Distinguished Graduate of Dalian City.

For my future plan, I am about to seek for a PhD in the US in the coming application period beginning in this September 2023.
