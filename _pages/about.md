About Myself
======
I am currently working as a 5G Baseband Software Developer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) in Stockholm, Sweden.

Prior to that, I obtained my MSc from [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/en) in 2023 and my programme was [ICT Innovation](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/ict-innovation) - track Cloud and Network Infrastructure at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855). During my master study, I did an one-year exchange during the 2021-2022 academic year at [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland where I also finished my master thesis. I achieved my BSc from the [School of Software Technology](https://ssdut.dlut.edu.cn/en.htm) of [Dalian University of Technology (DUT)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in Dalian, China in 2020.

For my future plan, I am about to seek for a PhD in the US in the coming application period beginning in this September 2023.

My Research Interests
======
My research interest, in one single sentence, is the design and optimization of networked system (especially for the low-latency network). Specifically, it straddles the complex domain of networked systems and its interdisciplinary interfaces, include but not limited to:
<ul id="research_interest">
 <li> Network resource allocation and deployment </li>
 <li> The research on Network Calculus itself and its application in the design of performance guaranteed networked systems </li>
 <li> The application of machine learning and game theory in the optimization of networked systems </li>
 <li> Telecom areas including 5G RAN and Cloud RAN (Now, I am working on the virtualized digital unit in uplink control plane)</li>
</ul>

Fun Facts
======
<ul id="fun_facts">
  <li>I still hold the habit of taking photographs. Compared to portraits, I focus more on the landscape where you can find my gallery on the tap above.</li>
  <li>I still do crazier things than most of my crazy friends. Skiing in the Swiss Alps during the winter ⛷️ (The Swiss black path is still challenging for me, but I can handle the blue and red ones without any difficulties) and diving in the Mediterranean during the summer 🤿 have been my annual sacred cow. Yes, I have an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ch8Ajgckvbv-Z73niMWj1QG_5HpNdOCn/view?usp=sharing">open water diving certificate</a>. I also have a plan to upgrade my diving certificate to an advanced one and perhaps try to do underwater photography.</li>
  <li>I still travel quite a lot. Currently, I've been to 🇹🇭 🇯🇵 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇳🇱 🇫🇮 🇸🇪 🇦🇹 🇨🇭 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇮🇹 🇳🇴 🇩🇪 🇮🇸 🇲🇨 🇲🇹 🇩🇰</li>
  <li>I don't drink alcohol. It is not because I don't want or I'm not allowed. It is because I'm allergic to alcohol, which makes me lose lots of fun in Europe</li>
  <li>I'm a Barcelona loyalist, and I've been watching Barcelona games since 2010.</li>
  <li>I am learning how to drive and my family has recently a new car. Due to these, I'm obsessed with performance cars, especially Audi RS7. However, I may bow to life and choose a Tesla Model 3 or Audi A3 at last. Oh, I also begin to watch F1 from this year.</li>
</ul>
